## Project Outline

### Background and research question
Joost van den Vondel, a prolific Dutch author, very famous even in his own time, joined the catholic church in 1640 after having been a well-known protestant for years. The Dutch had been at war with Spain's catholic monarch for decades, so catholicism wasn't well respected in the Netherlands at the time. An example of the power of the protestant church is Vondel's play Lucifer. Lucifer was only performed twice before it was banned under pressure of the protestant church. Their main criticism of the play was its display of religious figures like angels, God and the devil. Catholics were not against representing religious figures, but protestants deemed it as unacceptble. Vondel's personal life was also affected by his change of religious beliefs: his mother removed him from her will and he lost one of his dearest friends, the author P.C. Hooft (Schenkeveld-van der Dussen, 2004, pp. 298-300).

There was an upside to his change of church, however. Most prominent authors lived in Amsterdam - one of the few Dutch cities that were more accepting of catholicism. For this reason, catholicism was more prevalent in Amsterdam and specifically among authors. By becoming catholic, Vondel earned the respect of Amsterdam's artistic scene and was lauded as Prince of Poets in 1652 as a result. For this reason, academics have questioned Vondel's move to catholicism. For example, (Smit, 1956) argues that Vondel's religious beliefs didn't change throughout his life. According to him, Vondel's change to catholicism was merely strategic. Alternatively, (Molkenboer, 1932) argues the opposite in Wanner werd Vondel Katholiek. According to him, Vondel had a 'break' in his religious beliefs. Both use Vondels fiction as argument to support their viewpoints.

The academic debate on whether Vondel's change of church was strategic or not is ongoing. I'd like to approach this debate from a computational perspective. The research question I aim to answer is: "Did Joost van den Vondels religious beliefs change after he switched from a protestant church to a catholic church?"

### Data
The corpus I'll use comprises of a selection of Vondel's literary works. I will focus on his plays, because that is what Vondel is best known for. My plan is to use the series Vondels spelen as a guide for selecting plays, because it nearly all of Vondel's plays. The following is a list of plays mentioned in Vondels spelen (1912), most of these, if not all, should be available in the collections of Vondel's plays that are available on the website of project Gutenberg, which is where the text will be extracted from.

1. Het Pascha
2. Hierusalem verwoest
3. Palamedes
4. Gysbrecht van Aemstels
5. Maagden
6. Peter en Pauwels
7. Maria Stuart
8. De leeuwendalers
9. Gebroeders
10. Joseph in Dotan
11. Joseph in Egypte
12. Salomon
13. Lucifer
14. Salmoneus
15. Jephta
16. Samson
17. David in Ballingschap
18. David hersteld
19. Adonias
20. Adam in Ballingschap
21. FaÃ«ton
22. Batavische gebroeders
23. Zungchin
24. Noah

### Method
To answer my research question, I'll split the dataset in two parts: plays published before 1640 and plays published after 1640. These two parts will constitute the independent variable: year of publication. The dependent variable will be the frequency of the word 'God' in both groups of plays. After extracting these frequencies, they can be statistically analysed and interpreted. My hypothesis is that Vondel started using the word 'God' more after his switch to catholicism, because it would be more in line with catholic views to talk about God and religious figures.
