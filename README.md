## Project Outline

**Topic**
The religious ‘break’ of Joost van den Vondel


**What is known**
Joost van den Vondel joined the catholic church in 1640 after having been a well-known protestant author for years. There is academic debate about whether Vondel’s switch to catholicism was strategic or that he actually changed his religious beliefs. In other words, whether his change of protestantism to catholicism can actually be seen as a 'break' in his views.

**Research question**

"Are there differences in word frequency for the word “God” in Vondel’s plays from before and after 1640?"

**Variables**

Independent: year of publication (before or after 1640)

Dependent: word frequency of the word “God”

**Hypothesis**

After 1640, the word "God" will appear more in Vondel's plays because it is seen as more acceptable to talk about and represent God (and religious figures in general) in catholicism than it is in protestantism. This could, in a way, prove or disprove the idea that there was a change in Vondel's beliefs or whether his change of church had other explanations.

**Method**

- Selection of plays before and after 1640
- Creating a word list of God (and its spelling variants)
- Making all text lowercase and tokenizing the text
- Counting frequencies of the word "God" relative to the total amount of words per play
