2. Revise research question and hyptheses based on feedback
3. List at least two studies
4. Provide background information in abstract format

**Background**
In YEAR, the play Lucifer by Dutch author Joost van den Vondel was performed for the first time. A few days later it was performed again, for the last time while Van den Vondel was alive. After that the play was banned under pressure of the protestant church, who was very powerful at this time in the Netherlands. Despite this, Joost van den Vondel was at the time considered to be the king of poetry and he was a very proliferate playwright.  


The religious ‘break’ of Joost van den Vondel

**What is known**
Joost van den Vondel, a prolific Dutch author, very famous even in his own time, joined the catholic church in 1640 after having been a well-known protestant for years. The Dutch had been at war with Spain's catholic monarch for decades, so catholicism wasn't well respected in the Netherlands at the time. An example of the power of the protestant church is Vondel's play Lucifer. Lucifer was only performed twice before it was banned under pressure of the protestant church. The main criticism of Lucifer 

There is academic debate about whether Vondel’s switch to catholicism was strategic or that he actually changed his religious beliefs. In other words, whether his change of protestantism to catholicism can actually be seen as a 'break' in his views.

**Research question**
A possibility is that the after 1640, the word "God" will appear more in Vondel's plays because it is seen as more acceptable to talk about and represent God (and religious figures in general) in catholicism than it is in protestantism. This could, in a way, prove or disprove the idea that there was a change in Vondel's beliefs or whether his change of church had other explanations. The research question is: Did Joost van den Vondels religious beliefs change after he switched from a protestant church to a catholic church?

**Variables**

Independent: year of publication (before or after 1640)

Dependent: word frequency of the word “God”

**Hypothesis**

"Are there differences in word frequency for the word “God” in Vondel’s plays from before and after 1640?"


**Method**

- Selection of plays before and after 1640
- Creating a word list of God (and its spelling variants)
- Making all text lowercase and tokenizing the text
- Counting frequencies of the word "God" relative to the total amount of words per play

- Sampling method: hand selected plays before and after 1640.
- Data set. Complete works of joost van den vondel.
